      <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
      <p>We request information from the user on our contact form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and email address).  This information is used for correspondence purposes and to satisfy a customer's inquiry. This contact information is used to respond to the user.</p>
      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>Cookies are small text files a Web site uses to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's ongoing access to the site and facilitate the use of the site. "Cookies" also allow a site to track usage behavior and compile site usage information that will allow for the improvement of content. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Most Web site browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to display a warning before accepting a cookie, or to refuse all cookies. However, if you choose to disable the receipt of cookies from our website, it is possible that some areas of the site will not function properly. This is especially likely when trying to order a product or service.</p>
      <p>Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>
      <h2>Log Files</h2>
      <p>Our web servers automatically collect information about a site user's IP address, browser type and referrer by reading this information from the user's browser (information provided by every user's browser). This information is collected in a database and used--in an aggregated, anonymous manner--in our internal analysis of traffic patterns within our Web site.</p>
      <h2>Sharing</h2>
      <p>We partner with third party entities to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.</p>
      <h2>Links</h2>
      <p>Our websites may provide links to other third-party websites which are outside our control and not covered by this policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these (and all) sites.</p>
      <h2>Surveys &amp; Contests</h2>
      <p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.</p>
      <p>We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.</p>
      <p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:support@thoroughwiz.com">support@thoroughwiz.com</a>.</p>
      <h2>Site and Service Updates</h2>
      <p>We will notify users of site and service updates.</p>
      <h2>Children</h2>

      <h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
      <p>Any changes to the Terms of Service will be posted here. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>
      <h2>Your Consent</h2>
      <p>By using this website, you consent to the collection of information as described in this policy.</p>
      <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>We provide a service (information) to our customers.</p>
      <p>If a service is being provided with information procured from outside source, we inform our subscribers where that information is coming from, prior to completion of the sale, so they are, therefore, aware of exactly what type of information they will be receiving. Should these types of services be available online, the specific sources of the information will be detailed in the service description.</p>
      <p>Unlike companies that provide a tangible product that can be returned for a refund, our product is information. It can be used immediately upon receipt or viewing, and there is no product to return. Once a service has commenced, there can be no refund except as outlined in the sections that follow. Just as with the Stock Market, our customers must recognize that the information cannot be guaranteed, and that past performance is not a promise of future results. What is guaranteed is that each and every customer will receive the service that was purchased in full.</p>
      <p>Thoroughwiz WILL NOT provide a credit card or Stripe payment refund for any reason including termination of this Agreement except in the case of a Customer being incorrectly billed due to an error that is the fault of Thoroughwiz.</p>
      <p>Thoroughwiz WILL provide a partial or full refund to the Customer's account for any product purchased in the last 3 (three) days for any of the following reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The product purchased by the Customer contained data for the wrong track.</li>
        <li>The product purchased by the Customer contained data for the wrong date.</li>
        <li>The product contained incomplete data (except in the cases where this is explicitly notated).</li>
        <li>The product's data was corrupted (either blank or not human-readable).</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>No Warranty</h2>
      <p>THOROUGHWIZ MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THOSE OF MERCHANTABILITY AND/OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AS TO ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION, DATA PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS OR SERVICE USED OR FURNISHED, AND, AS TO THOROUGHWIZ, CUSTOMER SUBSCRIBES TO AND UTILIZES THE DATA PRODUCTS ON AN "AS IS" BASIS.</p>
