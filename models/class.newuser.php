<?php
/*
A class is a collection of variables and functions that work with those variables. Variables are defined by var and functions by function. A class is defined using the following syntax:
Basic class definitions begin with the keyword class, followed by a class name, followed by a pair of curly braces which enclose the definitions of the properties and methods belonging to the class.
Public: Public method or variable can be accessible from anywhere. Inside the class, outside the class and in child class also.
Private: Method or property with private visibility can only be accessible inside the class. You can not access private method or variable from outside of your class.
Protected: Method or variable with protected visibility can only be access in the derived class. Or in other word in child class. Protected will be used in the process of inheritance.
